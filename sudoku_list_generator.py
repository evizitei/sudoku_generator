# This function promises that when you invoke it and give it a pointer to a 
# nested list representing a sudoku board, and specify a cell to modify (with row/col)
# it will generate values to try until it finds one that fits and put that one in the 
# target cell.
#
# The mechanism is pretty brute force, it just guesses random values and sees if they have any conflicts in the sudoku
# board already until one fits (or until it's stuck).
# It accepts 3 arguments:
#.  - grid = a pointer to a nested list that represents a sudoku board.
#.           we would expect it to be a list of 9 rows, with row in the list
#.           being itself a list of 9 integers representing cells in that row.
#.           A zero in a given cell means nothing has been assigned to it yet.
#.  - row = a number between 0 and 8 specifying the row of the cell we're trying to choose a value for.
#.  - col = a number between 0 and 8 specifying the column of the cell we're trying to choose a value for
